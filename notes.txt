Question:
How to use the sign-up route? √

TODO: add checkAuth to critical routes √
      write tests to make sure checkAuth is working
      ask how to write documentation the endpoints

Questions:

    Requirements say this project must be deployed? Is github enough or what
    else do I need to do? *Deployed* √

    Received this message at last push to repo: 'GitHub found 8 vulnerabilities
    on MackRoe/Learn2Witch_API's default branch (1 critical, 3 high, 3 moderate,
    1 low).' --- What is causing this and how do I fix it?
    *Not Important to Fix* √

    Can I fix it so the route that shows all courses does not contains some of
    the fields in the model? I would like to make the content and url fields
    proprietary.
